**Data Analysis Final Project \- Bank Customer Analysis**

You have been provided with a dataset containing key demographic and financial details of bank customers. This dataset includes fields such as customer information (e.g., Name, Customer ID), financial performance indicators (e.g., Credit Score, Balance), and customer engagement metrics (e.g., Tenure, Number of Products, IsActiveMember). Additionally, it includes whether the customer has exited the bank or remains active. Your goal is to analyze the dataset to gain insights into customer behavior, financial standing, and engagement patterns.

Hint: The excel workbook contains two sheets: Customer and Account data. Read in the data separately and do a join on the common key to merge them.

###  Assignment

As a data analyst, your task is to explore and analyze this customer dataset to uncover valuable insights for the bank's decision-making process. You will focus on understanding the demographic and financial characteristics of the bank's customers, identifying trends and patterns in customer engagement, and highlighting potential areas for business improvement (e.g., customer retention or service optimization).

### Objectives

1. Demographic Analysis:  
   * Analyze the distribution of customers based on geography, gender, and age.  
   * Identify any demographic segments (e.g., by geography or gender) that have a significantly different credit score, balance, or other financial metrics.  
2. Customer Engagement Patterns:  
   * Investigate the relationship between customer tenure and engagement (such as the number of products owned, HasCrCard, and IsActiveMember).  
   * Analyze the impact of tenure on customer behavior, especially focusing on long-term customer patterns (e.g., do longer-tenured customers tend to hold more products or have higher balances?).  
3. Financial Performance:  
   * Explore credit score distribution and identify which customer segments (e.g., age, gender, geography) tend to have higher or lower credit scores.  
   * Analyze customer balance and estimated salary patterns and compare them across different demographic groups.  
4. Exited Customers Analysis:  
   * Compare the financial and demographic characteristics of customers who exited the bank versus those who remain active.  
   * Identify possible factors (e.g., age, credit score, balance) associated with customers exiting the bank.  
5. Customer Segmentation:  
   * Based on the available data, identify distinct customer segments (e.g., high-balance vs. low-balance customers) and analyze their unique characteristics.  
   * Provide insights into how the bank could optimize its services for each segment, such as offering tailored products to certain demographics or improving engagement with less active members.

This analysis will help the bank improve customer retention strategies, optimize financial products, and better understand customer behavior across different segments.
