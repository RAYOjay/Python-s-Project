### Observations
* Customer Tenure is  related to customer engagement. Longer-tenured customers may more products, be more active, and have higher balances and credit scores.
Customer Segmentation based on tenure helped identify groups with different behaviors targeted at  long-term customers for loyalty programs or tailor offerings for newer customers.
By performing these analyses, it helps understands customer financial patterns in greater detail and uncover trends related to demographics, balances, credit scores, and salaries. These insights are valuable for targeting different customer groups with customized financial products or services.
By analyzing customer segments and their churn rates, you can derive insights on which segments are more likely to exit and take actions accordingly, such as:

High churn rate: Implement retention strategies for high-churn segments.

### Summary
The analysis reveals that the bank has a larger proportion of long-term customers with high credit scores. Additionally, 51.5% of customers are active, while 48.5% are inactive

The data also indicates that the majority of the bank's customers are middle-aged adults, aged between 31 and 50 years. Furthermore, customers with a tenure of 1-3 years have the highest number of active account.


The location Germany has the highest salary distribution, with females earning slightly more than males.
The bank has a larger number of customers in the 51-60 age range, who also tend to have higher account balances.


### Insights 
* The bank has a strong base of long-term customers who are financially stable (high credit scores). This group is likely to be loyal and reliable, presenting an opportunity for the bank to foster deeper relationships.

* Customer Segmentation: The bank has clear demographic clusters (long-term customers, middle-aged adults, high-balance older clients), and its strategy should cater to these groups differently. This segmentation can lead to more personalized offerings and higher customer retention.


* Product and Service Customization: Tailor products to the specific needs of each group, such as retirement-focused products for older customers and family-focused products for middle-aged customers.

*Retention and Reactivation Strategies: While active customers represent a significant portion of the base, there is a near-equal share of inactive customers. This represents an opportunity to engage with dormant clients through targeted reactivation strategies.


## Recommendations

* The bank should tailor financial products or financial education initiatives aimed at closing this salary gap. For example, offering specialized advice or investment products targeting women could be a way to address financial equality, particularly in a market like Germany, where the gender pay gap is a recognized issue.

* The bank should focus on wealth management services for this group, including retirement planning, investment opportunities, and estate planning. Personalized advisory services could help them manage their assets as they approach retirement. Additionally, targeted savings or investment products can help cater to their specific financial needs.

* The bank should explore ways to reactivate dormant customers, such as offering incentives, personalized communication, or tailored product recommendations. Targeted campaigns could encourage re-engagement, especially for those who may have been inactive for a certain period

* The bank could focus on rewarding this loyal customer segment through personalized offers, enhanced customer service, and targeted financial products (e.g., premium credit cards, investment opportunities).
